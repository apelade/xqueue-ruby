x_queue: a gem for creating OpenEdX external graders in Ruby
============================================================

Documentation coming real soon now.

The idea is you can use this as part of your server-side [external
autograder
code](http://edx-partner-course-staff.readthedocs.org/en/latest/exercises_tools/external_graders.html)
to keep your autograder logic separate from the XQueue API needed for it
to retrieve student assignments submitted through OpenEdX and to post
back scores for the assignments.
